Network communications are like food - flavors are endless and choices are almost unlimited.

And just like there is no dish that would taste the best to everyone - there is no ideal network solution for everyone - it depends on the target audience.

And one of the best ways to understand your audience is to test it. Objectively. Understong what works, and what doesn't.

Probnic provides a framework to get a taste of your network.
