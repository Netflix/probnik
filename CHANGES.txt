Renames:
FTLProbe -> Probe
FTLProbeImpl -> BrowserProbe
Scenario -> recipe

Recipe(scenario) format changes:
1. Added "type" field (to support different probe types)
2. logblob -> name (for a recipe name)
3. URL -> target (as URL won't always be the identified of the request)
4. Added start to the Pulse report
5. Dropped monotonic param

Structure:
1. Moved steering URL from Probe param to a RecipeProvider interface, allowing different ways to provide a Probe recipe
2. Split requester into 2 interfaces:
- one to get metrics (generic interface used by Probe)
- one to get HTTP response (only used by recipe provider)

Caveats:
* No full integration in probe to support running multiple Test types
* No documentation for scheduler
